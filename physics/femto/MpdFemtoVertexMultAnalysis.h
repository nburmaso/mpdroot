/**
 * \class MpdFemtoVertexMultAnalysis
 * \brief Perform femtoscopic analysis using z- and multiplicity binnings
 *
 * Femtoscopic analysis which mixes events with respect to the logitudinal (z)
 * position of the primary vertex and event total multiplicity. These
 * parameters are only set via the constructor.
 *
 * Binning is done by using the mPicoEventCollectionVectorHideAway member
 * provided by the superclass AliFemtoSimpleAnalysis. It should be noted that
 * this member is not created or deleted by the superclass, so this class
 * deletes the member in its destructor.
